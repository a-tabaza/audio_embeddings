# Audio Embeddings Using VGGish
This repository contains the code to extract audio embeddings using VGGish model. The VGGish model is a variant of the VGG architecture that is trained to predict AudioSet embeddings. The model is trained on a large dataset of audio and is able to extract embeddings that can be used for audio classification, retrieval, and other audio-related tasks.
